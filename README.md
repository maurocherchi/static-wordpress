## Setup

Prerequisites:
* AWS account
* AWS CDK installed in your dev environment

First, you need to buy your domain, once you have your domain you can deploy this stack.

Note: If you buy it using Route 53, you can either:
* Keep the default hosted zone and change the distribution stack to use it (HostedZone.fromHostedZoneAttributes(...))
* Delete the default hosted zone, let the stack create a new one, change the Name Servers associated with your domain name

If you buy the domain outside of AWS, once the stack is deployed you have to change the Name Servers associated with
your domain, with the ones that AWS will assign to the hosted zone created by the stack.

Once you have deployed the stack:
* Configure WordPress to use only HTTPS
  * https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/wordpress/administration/force-https-apache/
* Modify WordPress domain name to use HTTPS `/opt/bitnami/wordpress/wp-config.php`
  * https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/wordpress/administration/configure-domain/
* Configure Simply Static plugin to clean the folder before static content generation
